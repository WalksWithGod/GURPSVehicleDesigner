<P><i>Special note: The initial errata for this book were compiled by
the author, David Pulver. We thank David for the dedication with which
he supports his readers!</i>

<P>The * before a page number indicates a change which directly
affects vehicle design.

<DL>

<DT>P. 7, last paragraph, first sentence.
<DD>Change ``hull strength'' to ``body strength''.

<DT>*P. 7.
<DD>In the line after XH maximum load just after the example, add the
following: ``For bodies under 25 cf, use half body armor factor
instead of volume when calculating maximum load. See <i>Body Armor
Factor,</i> p. 8.''

<DT>*P. 8.
<DD>Under the body cost and mass table, add the following: ``For
bodies under 25 cf, use half body armor factor instead of volume when
calculating body cost and body mass.''

<DT>*P. 10, Sloped Sides.
<DD>In reference to aerodynamic streamlining's effect on slope,
``partial or better'' should be ``fair or better.''

<DT>P. 10, sidebar.
<DD>1 liter = .26 US gallons, or about one quart. 1 U.S. gallon equals
3.785 liters.

<DT>P. 11, Ground Motive System, paragraph 3, line 1:
<DD>''skitracks (TL7)'' should be ``skitracks (TL6)''.

<DT>P. 11, Powered Motive System, tracks, line 5.
<DD>''tracks motive system'' should be ``a tracked motive system''.

<DT>*P. 12 sidebar.
<DD>Armor Factor and HT Table. There are some rounding errors. Use the
following:

<PRE>
      to .26 should be AF 2. 
     .27-.4  should be AF 3. 
      .5-.6  should be AF 4. 
      .7-1.1 should be AF 6. 
     1.2-1.6 should be AF 8. 
     1.7-2.3 should be AF 10. 
     2.4-3   should be AF 12. 
     3.1-4.1 should be AF 15. 
     4.2-6.3 should be AF 20. 
     6.4-8.7 should be AF 25. 
     8.8-11  should be AF 30. 
     269-353 should be AF 300. 
     354-543 should be AF 400.
</PRE>

<P>Lower in the table, ``268,960-353,450'' should be ``268,961-353,450''.
``1,397,460-2,151,345'' should be ``1,397,461-2,151,345''.

<DT>P. 13.
<DD>Under Motive System HT, last line before Motive System Upgrades,
change the sidebar reference from p. 157 to p. 159.

<DT>*P. 13.
<DD>Armor Factor and HT sidebar: In the third paragraph, ``round to
nearest 10,000'' should be ``round up to nearest 50,000''.

<DT>P. 14.
<DD>Damage Effects, 4th line: Change ``exceeds'' to ``equals.''

<DT>P. 14.
<DD>Flotation Systems, damage effects, first sentence: ``If the hull
takes enough damage'' should be ``If the body takes enough damage''.

<DT>P. 14.
<DD>Flotation Systems, damage effects, second paragraph: delete ``(2
yards/turn if already underwater)''.

<DT>P. 15.
<DD>Example: ``but see the gasbag example'' should be ``but see the
gasbag and wing examples''.

<DT>*P. 16.
<DD>The Useful Lift for a TL7+ non-rigid helium gasbag should be 50,
not 30.

<DT>P. 17.
<DD>Wings, airplanes, 2nd sentence: ``To create an airplane turn to
the'' (etc.) should be ``To create an airplane, add wings (see below),
then turn to the'' (etc.).

<DT>P. 17.
<DD>Watercraft Modifications (Continued) sidebar:  The Flarecraft Body is TL7.

<DT>*P. 18.
<DD>Wing Options (SB): biplane and triplane options refer to ``full''
streamlining. This should be ``good'' streamlining.

<DT>P. 18.
<DD>Add a new wing option - Divebrakes. These are large flaps designed
to slow an aircraft's speed. They are often installed on dive bombers.
They may be combined with any wing options. They add 5% to wing cost
and mass, but increase aerial deceleration by 5 mph/s.

<DT>P. 18.
<DD>Paragraph 3, beginning ``Wings will also usually'' should be
deleted.

<DT>P. 19.
<DD>Rotary wing, 2nd sentence: ``either autogyros and helicopters''
should be ``either autogyros or helicopters''. Also, to Damage
Effects: Add ``The rotor is damaged on rotor hit location results.''
Stall speed of autogyros should be 15 mph, not 30 mph.

<DT>*P. 19.
<DD>Hovercraft stabilizers should actually ``add .25 to the
hovercraft's MR and 1 to SR'', not ``1 to the hovercraft's MR and
SR''.

<DT>*P. 19.
<DD>Wing Options sidebar: The Flying Wing option subtracts 1 from SR,
not 2. Forward swept wing: ``Full'' streamlining should be ``very
good'' streamlining. Variable sweep wing: Reference to ``radical or
super'' streamlining should be to ``excellent or radical''
streamlining.  Waverider: These actually subtract 2.75 from MR and 1
from SR.

<DT>*P. 20.
<DD>Base volume of a contragrav unit is ``.4 cf'' not ``.04 cf''.
Stats for TL13+ contragrav are missing. Add: ``At TL13+, a contragrav
unit costs $500 plus $.005 per pound of vehicle maximum load. It
masses 10 lbs. plus .0005 lbs. per pound of vehicle maximum load. It
takes up .1 cf plus .00001 cf per pound of maximum load. It requires
.001 KW of power per pound of vehicle maximum load.''

<DT>P. 21.
<DD>Oars are TL1, paddles are TL0. Also: ``flexibody motive system and
drivetrain (TL8)'' should be added to the list of applicable
propulsion systems for both flotation hull and submersible hull.

<DT>P. 21.
<DD>Afterburner sidebar: thrust-to-weight should be thrust-to-mass.

<DT>*P. 22.
<DD>SB Motive power and thrust: Add to the last sentence of the last
paragraph: <BLOCKQUOTE> ``If calculating the motive power required for
a vehicle flying via hovercraft lift, add an extra .02 KW of motive
power per pound of estimated loaded mass (.04 lbs. of thrust per pound
of mass if a reaction engine). If calculating the thrust required for
a vehicle flying via vertol lift, add an extra pound of thrust per
pound of estimated mass.''  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<DT>P. 23.
<DD>Number of Rowers table: ``none'' should be ``poor''.

<DT>P. 24.
<DD>Ground Speed Factor (continued): For powered wheels and wheeled
drivetrain, TL8 design should be TL8+ design. For Tracks, Halftracks
and Skitracks, TL7 design should be TL7+ design. For Halftracks and
Skitracks the italic header should add ``and tracked drivetrain''; for
legs, the italic headers should add ``... and leg drivetrain.''

<DT>P. 24.
<DD>HT and Damage: ``will breaking and doing'' should be ``will break
and does''.

<DT>P. 25.
<DD>The ship in the example could have up to four masts, not two.

<DT>*P. 25-26, SB.
<DD>Water speed factor, Propulsion System: ``Oars: 20 mph.'' should be
``Oars or paddles: 20 mph''. The Albacore hull modifier should be
``-4'' instead of ``-4/+4''. Propulsion factors for flexibody should
be 4mph for TL8, 8 mph for TL9.

<DT>*P. 26.
<DD>Drivetrains: TL5 should be TL5+. In the second paragraph ``. . .
and calculate the mass, volume and HT of the drivetrain,'' delete
``HT'' and add: ``The absolute minimum cost of a leg or (and at TL8+,
flexibody) drivetrain is 5,000 at TL7, 2,500 at TL8, 1,000 at TL9, and
500 at TL10+.''

<DT>*P. 27.
<DD>Under Screw Propellers, delete the requirement for mechanics - the
general maintenance rules apply.

<DT>P. 29.
<DD>In Aquajets and MHD Tunnels, under damage: ``(using the screw
propeller)'' should be ``(using the aquajet or MHD tunnel).''

<DT>*P. 29, sidebar.
<DD>Under Multiple Power Plants or Reaction Engines: Delete the last
paragraph (which begins ``A vehicle with multiple...'' It is a
leftover from an earlier draft.

<DT>P. 29.
<DD>The Ornithopter head should read ``Ornithopter Powertrains
(TL7+)''.

<DT>*P. 29.
<DD>The reference to ``partial'' streamlining under ornithopters
should be to ``fair'' streamlining.

<DT>*P. 29.
<DD>Under <i>Ornithopter</i> replace the fourth paragraph with this
one: ``An ornithopter powertrain reduces the vehicle's stall speed.
Total the combined lift from any vectored thrust or contragrav the
vehicle has, and add the ornithopter lift, which is equal to
drivetrain motive power x4 at TL7 or lower, x5 at TL8 or higher.  The
combined lift will subtract a percentage from the stall speed equal to
(100 x lift/loaded mass).  The minimum stall speed is 0.  If stall
speed is reduced to 0, the vehicle can hover like a hummingbird,
creating a vertical takeoff/landing aircraft that flies much like a
helicopter.''

<DT>P. 30.
<DD>Ornithopters, Damage Effects: Damage effects should be ``Damage:''
Reference to ``propellers'' should be to ``ornithopter powertrains''.

<DT>P. 30.
<DD>The head for Helicopter Powertrains should read ``Helicopter
Powertrains (TL6+).''

<DT>*P. 31.
<DD>Under Engine Pods, add: ``Up to two reaction engine pods or
reactionless thruster engine pods may also be attached to the back or
underside if the vehicle has a vertol lift system.'' (The sample
battlesuit uses this option.)

<DT>P. 33.
<DD>In the second paragraph (beginning with ``* Listed fuel''), the
second sentence ``HT is based on volume...'' should be offset as a new
paragraph.

<DT>P. 33.
<DD>In the example, the cost for the reaction engine should be
$165,000, not $115,000.

<DT>P. 35.
<DD>Under the <i>Exotic Power Plants</i> sidebar, the Vampire
bioconvertor requires 1 gallon of blood per KW per day.  The average
human body has 1.25 gallons of blood, not 1.5 gallons.

<DT>P. 36.
<DD>In the Power Plant Table, under TL8 ceramic engine, on the second
line, change ``turbo or supercharger'' to ``turbosupercharger''.

<DT>P. 36, sidebar.
<DD>Under <i>Air-Golem Engines</i>, only <i>three</i> permanent
    Air Golem enchantments are needed, for a total of 1200 energy
    points per KW.

<DT>P. 37.
<DD>Add: Calculating Miles Per Gallon. Miles per gallon (or per pound
of coal, or KWH of energy) can be calculated by selecting a cruising
speed (for land vehicles, usually 60 mph or top ground speed,
whichever is worse). Divide this by the fuel or energy used per hour
to find miles per gallon.

<DT>*P. 41.
<DD>Under Superstructures, the reference to ``partial'' or better
streamlining should be to ``fair'' or better.

<DT>*P. 42.
<DD>Under Turrets, the reference to ``partial'' or better streamlining
should be to ``fair'' or better. Power requirement is actually .1 KW
of power per cf of turret size, and drain is 1/36,000 of a KWH per
second per cf.

<DT>*P. 43.
<DD>Under Mini-Turrets: A mini-turret gets 50% of the DR of the armor
location it is mounted on, not the same DR. PD is calculated based on
the lower DR.

<DT>P. 43.
<DD>The mass calculation in the turret example is wrong - it should be
8 lbs., not 6, for a total of 40 lbs., not 30.

<DT>*P. 44.
<DD>Under Armor and Damage Resistance, the reference to ``partial'' or
better aerodynamics should be to ``fair'' or better.

<DT>*P. 44.
<DD>In the ``Backpack Vehicles'' sidebar, a human is 2.925 cu, not 6 cu.

<DT>*P. 45.
<DD>On the Armor Table, the last three TLs should be headed TL11,
TL12, and TL13+ instead of TL13, TL14, and TL15+. Add: ``See p. 162
for recovery rates for regenerating ablative armor.'' (Note that the
recovery rates are on this errata sheet - they aren't ON page 162
yet!) In the example, the reference to ``expensive'' armor should be
to ``advanced'' armor.

<DT>P. 46.
<DD>The example has problems. Chiton has no mini-airlock - delete
reference to it. Cost of laser rangefinder is $5,000, not $1,000. Cost
of laser sensors is $25,000, not $12,500. The mini-ladar is found on
p. 75 - delete the TL reference; it masses 5 lbs., takes up .1 cf and
has HT 2 {see errata}. The computer requires .1 cf and is on p. 82.
Total volume is 5.3 cf, not 30.1 cf. Total cost is $125,400, not
$113,000. Total mass is 912 lbs., not 1,157 lbs.

<DT>P. 47.
<DD>In the example: Delete the reference to TL9 weapons. Linking the
rockets costs 50. Total mass is 460 lbs. Total cost is $15,400.

<DT>*P. 47.
<DD>In the DR of Internal Components sidebar, electronic components
have DR 3 (as given in the examples), not DR 2.

<DT>P. 47, sidebar.
<DD>The Chiton example is wrong. Change the second sentence to: ``The
leg DR is based on the underside DR 80: (DR 80 x 2)/4 = DR 40.''

<DT>P. 48.
<DD>Chiton's components actually total up 194.98 cf. This leaves 5.02
cf.

<DT>P. 48, sidebar.
<DD>Chiton's legs should be DR 40.

<DT>*P. 48.
<DD>A vehicle can be built with a maximum number of hardpoints up to
its body armor factor/50 if it has wings, not its body armor
factor/100.

<DT>P. 50.
<DD>In the example, add to the list of costs, ``its submersible hull
costs $3,200''. Its accessories actually cost $125,400. Its weapons
actually cost $15,400. Its total design cost is actually $289,898. Add
to the list of masses, ``its submersible hull masses 600 lbs.'' Its
accessories actually mass 912 lbs. Its weapons and ammunition actually
mass 460 lbs. Its total design mass is 9,563.2 lbs. Its maximum
payload is 14,413 lbs.

<P>The sentence ``Its max cargo load is 20.22 (cargo space) x 12,000
(maximum load) /200 (body volume) = 1,332 lbs.'' must be changed to
``its max cargo load is 5.02 (cargo space) x 12,000 (maximum load) /200
(body volume) = 301.2 lbs.''

<P>The phrase: ``... 20.22-cf cargo bay usually carries either an extra
person or two, or 450 lbs. of miscellaneous equipment (e.g., diving
tanks, weapons, cutting torches, explosives) for a total ``current
payload'' of 850 lbs....'' ...'' should be changed to ``... 5.02 cf cargo
bay usually carries 35 lbs. of miscellaneous equipment (e.g., diving
tanks, weapons, cutting torches, explosives) for a total ``current
payload'' of 440 lbs.''

<P>Under loaded mass, change 9,148.2 to 9,558.2 and change 850 lbs. to
440 lbs. Actual loaded mass remains 9,998.2 lbs.

<DT>*P. 50.
<DD>In the fourth paragraph under Top Ground Speed, after the sentence
ending `` . . .  its power-to-mass ratio, add the following vital
sentence: ``Then take that power-to-mass ratio to the power factor
table on p. 61 and find the power factor.''

<DT>*P. 52.
<DD>The last two paragraphs in the Anachronistic Devices sidebar
(beginning ``Helicopters with'' and ``If a battlesuit'' do not belong
in this sidebar (or anywhere else in the book!) and should be ignored
completely.

<DT>*P. 53.
<DD>Under Maximum Underwater Speed, delete the sentence beginning
``Its underwater maximum speed...'' and replace with ``Vehicles with
submersible hulls calculate two water speed factors. As shown on the
water speed factor sidebar on pages 25-26, their underwater speed
factor is calculated in the same way as their surface speed factor,
except there is a -4 mph penalty if they have no albacore hull, and a
+4 mph bonus if they have such a hull.''

<DT>P. 53.
<DD>''Flexibody suspension'' should be ``flexibody motive system''.

<DT>P. 54.
<DD>The example was omitted from Water Speed and Acceleration:
``Example: We calculate Chiton's water speed factor with its screw
propeller as 8 mph (see Water Speed Factor sidebar, p. 00). Its screw
propeller has a motive power of 320 KW. Its loaded mass is 5 tons.
320/5 gives a 64 to 1 power-to-mass ratio. Looking this up on the
power factor chart gives Chiton a power factor of 4. Multiplying this
by speed factor 8 mph gives Chiton a top water speed of 32 mph.
Multiplying power factor by .5 gives Chiton an acceleration of 2
mph/s. For underwater travel, Chiton's speed factor is only 4, thanks
to the t-4 speed factor penalty for underwater movement. Speed factor
4 x power factor 4 gives Chiton a top underwater speed of 16 mph.''

<DT>P. 54.
<DD>In the Windows and Vision sidebar, delete the referent-less
asterisk. Add ``Windowless vehicles fitted with the TL8+ virtual
panorama system (p. 76) can see perfectly.''

<DT>P. 55.
<DD>In Air Speed and Acceleration, 1st line, delete the reference to
``causing speed.'' (And no, it shouldn't be to cruising speed -
there's no such thing.)

<DT>*P. 56.
<DD>Under Aerial Deceleration, the reference to ``superior, radical or
super'' streamlining should be to ``superior, excellent or radical.''
The divebrake modifier is ``+5,'' not ``-5.'' Deceleration for
hovercraft flight systems has an error: it should be ``6 mph + half
acceleration (round to nearest mph).''

<DT>*P. 56.
<DD>In the Aerial MR table, under wings, add an entry for
``variable-sweep . . . . + (TL-6) x .25.''

<DT>*P. 57.
<DD>In the Aerial SR Table, add a footnote to vertol lift: ``A vertol
lift system does not reduce a vehicle's aerial SR if the vehicle also
has wings.''

<DT>P. 57, sidebar.
<DD>Chiton's legs have ``DR 40L'' rather than ``DR 30L.'' Under
``accessories,'' delete the mini-airlock. Add global positioning
system just after mini-cam. ``Cargo hold'' is actually ``5.02'' cf.
Corrected statistics: cost is $289,898, design mass is 9,563.2 lbs.,
max payload is 14,413 lbs., current payload is 435 lbs., cargo payload
is 300.2 lbs., IR signature is 0.

<DT>*P. 58.
<DD>The calculation for ceiling for wings is inaccurate for winged
aircraft with speeds over 400 mph. Add the following sentence: ``If
the ceiling for winged aircraft is over 12,000 yards, recalculate the
ceiling as (calculated ceiling/10) + 10,800 yards.''

<DT>*P. 58.
<DD>Under Size Modifier, the second paragraph should read: ``If the
vehicle has gasbags, turrets, superstructures, open mount weapons,
legs, arms or pods, add their volume to the body volume to find the
external volume of the vehicle. For this rule, the volume of legs is
60% of the body volume. The volume of all wings is 50% of the body
volume. The volume of arms is 5% of body volume per light arm, 10% for
heavy arms. To determine size modifier, use the table below, and find
table, and find the volume on the table that is closest to the
vehicle's size (if two volumes are equally close, use the higher).
This gives the size modifier.''

<P>The paragraph headed ``Other Size Modifier'' should be changed to
read: ``The size modifiers of the body, gasbags, turrets,
superstructures, pods and open mounts can be calculated separately in
case they are specifically targeted - see p. 155. Since the other
subassemblies (legs, arms, etc.) are in proportion to body size, a
size modifier is not necessary - targeting them is resolved at the
listed penalty to hit.'' (Note also the errata to p. 155.)

<DT>P. 58.
<DD>The Volume column in the Vehicle Size Modifier Table should read as
follows after 1728: 4096; 13,824; 32,768; 110,592; 262,144; 884,736;
2,097,152; 7,077,888; 16,777,216; 56,623,104.

<DT>P. 59, sidebar.
<DD>The reference to Powered Motive System hits should be to Wheeled
Motive System hits.


<DT>P. 60.
<DD>In the IR and Acoustic Signature Example, taking into account the
above changes, the first sentence should read: ``Chiton's size is 360
cf (its 200 cf body + 70% for its legs and two light arms), so its
size modifier is +3.'' IR Signature: The result should be 0, not -2.
Acoustic Signature: The result should be 0, not -1.

<DT>P. 60.
<DD>Under Chameleon Systems, the penalty for ghost surface if
stationary is -10 from vision and attack rolls, not -9.

<DT>P. 60.
<DD>Under Recording Vehicle Statistics, delete the reference to Chiton
appearing in the sample vehicle sidebar. Actually it appears on p. 57.

<DT>P. 65.
<DD>Under Component Armor, ``will to protect'' should be ``will
protect''.

<DT>P. 67.
<DD>Under Force Screens, 2nd paragraph, 4th line: Change p. 64 to p.
65. ``To operate forcefields one a minute-by-minute'' should be ``to
operate forcefields on a minute-by-minute''.

<DT>P. 69.
<DD>Under Radar Detectors, first paragraph, change ``utterly useless''
to ``less effective''.

<DT>P. 69.
<DD>Reduce the TL of all living metal systems by 1.

<DT>P. 70.
<DD>Reflective Coating should be TL8+, not TL8.

<DT>P. 71.
<DD>Safety Switches. In the first sentence, ``gives the vehicle into''
should be ``gives the vehicle'' and ``turn on the device'' should be
``turns on the screen or web''.

<DT>*P. 74.
<DD>The base TL at which the typical range of short range gravscanners
is calculated at is TL11, not TL7. () are missing in the last two
entries of the last column. ``Add 50% to range per TL after TL11''
should be ``double range every TL after TL11''.

<DT>*P. 74.
<DD>Under Infrared and Thermograph Sensors, ``Add 50% to range per TL
after TL7'' should be ``double range every TL after TL7''. Short-range
thermograph mass is 5 lbs., volume is .1 cf, HT 2. (Note that these
values are already used in all sample vehicles in the book . . .)
Short range TG mass is 5 lbs., volume .1 cf, HT 2.

<DT>*P. 75.
<DD>Mini-ladar should be 5 lbs. mass, .1 cf, HT 2.

<DT>P. 75.
<DD>Under Magnetic Anomaly Detectors, ``given them battlefield''
should be ``giving them battlefield''. Delete the disclaimer about
cost, mass, etc. not reducing with TL. ``Add 50% to range per TL after
TL7'' should be ``double range every TL after TL7''.

<DT>*P. 75.
<DD>The reference to mini-multiscanner should be to short range, to
tactical multiscanner should be to medium range. Mass of short range
multiscanner is 5 lbs., volume is .1 cf, HT is 2. (Note that these
values are already used in all sample vehicles in the book . . .)

<DT>*P. 75.
<DD>Multiscanners' ranges double at TL10 and again at TL 11, instead
of increasing by 50%.

<DT>*P. 76.
<DD>Mini-Radar mass is 5 lbs., volume is .1 cf, HT 2. (Note that these
values are already used in all sample vehicles in the book . . .)

<DT>*P. 76.
<DD>Mini-sound detector mass is 5 lbs., volume .1 cf, HT 2. (Note that
these values are already used in all sample vehicles in the book...)
Base ranges for sound detectors are missing. Typical range for mini
sound detector is half a mile, for short range sound detector is 1
mile, for medium range is 2 miles, and for long range is 4.5 miles.
This doubles every TL after TL7.

<DT>*P. 76.
<DD>Light amplification cost should drop to $300 at TL8, and $150 at
TL9+.

<DT>P. 78.
<DD>Under Laser Designator, ``light'' designator should be ``basic''
designator.

<DT>*P. 78.
<DD>Mass of midget Targeting Computer is 2 lbs., not 5 lbs.

<DT>P. 79.
<DD>Anchors are TL1+, not TL1.

<DT>P. 80.
<DD>''Harmonic'' convertor should be ``mana'' convertor. Under motive
system, add ``If the motive system is biomechanical, the drivetrain
must also be biomechanical.''

<DT>P. 81.
<DD>In the sentence beginning ``A vehicle with a plow cannot have . .
.'' delete the second occurrence of ``plow''.

<DT>P. 82.
<DD>Under Computers, in ``The number of programs that can be run
consecutively'' change ``consecutively'' to ``concurrently''.

<DT>*P. 83.
<DD>A dumb minicomputer (only) is 5% of cost, (making it cheaper but
bulkier than a normal midget computer).

<DT>P. 83.
<DD>Convertibles and Covered Decks are TL1+. In ``will be catch
fire,'' delete ``be''.

<DT>P. 83.
<DD>Under Emergency Lights and Sirens, ``flashlight light'' should be
``flashing light''.

<DT>*P. 83.
<DD>Equipment Pod volume may not exceed ``50%'' of the vehicle's body
volume, not ``5%''.

<DT>*P. 84.
<DD>After the sentence ``A flying vehicle can land on a flight deck if
there is room,'' add: ``This is simple for aircraft without stall
speeds - the aircraft just maneuvers over the deck and lands.'' The
length of the flight deck is .8 x top deck area (see p. 40). Add: ``In
order for an aircraft with a stall speed to land on a flight deck, it
should have arrestor gear. Arrestor gear costs 10% of the body cost.
It masses 5% of body mass; volume is negligible.''

<DT>*P. 87.
<DD>Provisions as listed are per person. This ignores dried and
dehydrated foods, but total mass comes out the same if water must be
carried!

<DT>P. 87.
<DD>Under Radio and Other Broadcast Communications, 1st column, last
line, the reference should be to p. 90.

<DT>P. 88.
<DD>Under IFF or Commercial Transponder, 3rd line, change ``encoded''
to ``uncoded.''

<DT>P. 89.
<DD>Under Searchlight, the reference to passive IR should be to page
74.

<DT>P. 89.
<DD>Television is TL7+.

<DT>*P. 89.
<DD>The Skyhook Catcher is TL7+, not TL7. A skyhook catcher has ten
times the cost and mass of a skyhook harness, and no volume. Cost is
$5,000.

<DT>P. 90.
<DD>Data transmission rates should be as follows: radio, 100 megs per
minute. Microwave: 10 gigabytes per minute. Laser: 1,000 gigs per
minutes. Neutrino, 100 gigs per minute.

<DT>P. 90.
<DD>Tractor beams are TL11+, not TL11. ``... 10 yards/turn divided by
mass'' should be ``100 mph divided by mass in tons, with a maximum
speed of 10 mph''. For light tractor beams, change the first sentence
to read: ``A light tractor beam is similar, but moves objects at a
speed of 10 mph divided by the object's mass in tons, with a maximum
speed of 10 mph.''

<DT>P. 91.
<DD>The Vehicle Launched Bridge is TL7+. The reference to ``breach
capacity'' should refer to the p. 173 sidebar.

<DT>P. 91.
<DD>The Winch is TL5+, not TL5. ``Half speed is pulling'' should be
``half speed if pulling.''

<DT>P. 93.
<DD>Under Targeting, ``Wear to aim'' should be ``where to aim.''

<DT>P. 93.
<DD>Expert systems should be complexity 3, as in Ultra-Tech and Space.

<DT>P. 95.
<DD>The Ram is TL1+, not TL1.

<DT>P. 103.
<DD>Under Very High RoF, in the last line before Autocannon Table:
Switch the words ``hit'' and ``miss''.

<DT>P. 104.
<DD>Under Howitzers, Mortars, Gun-Mortars and Grenade Launchers, 1st
paragraph, 3rd line, change ``p. 104'' reference to ``p. 156.'' Also,
the reference to indirect fire rules on p. 104 should be to p. 156 and
<b><i>GURPS High-Tech</i></b>.

<DT>P. 105.
<DD>In the sidebar, the reference to ``Weapons Effect Tables'' should
be ``Weapon Tables''.

<DT>P. 106.
<DD>In the Ammunition sidebar, the reference to Roundshot DR should
change from ``10 x normal value'' to ``5 x normal value'' to
correspond with p. 97.

<DT>P. 107.
<DD>In the Ammunition sidebar, HE, 1st paragraph, 8th line, change
``LE'' to ``EX''.  P. 111: Ammunition (sb): Duration is 300 seconds
divided by wind speed in mph, except for persistent nerve gas, whose
duration is already given.

<DT>P. 111.
<DD>Water cannon damage is 1 hit per yard, not 1 hit per 2 yards, of
knockback. (The footnote on p. 197 is correct.)

<DT>P. 112.
<DD>Water cannon, last paragraph, second last sentence, should read:
``Water cannon can also be connected to a hydrant for unlimited
ammunition - use the statistics for fire hoses on p. 84 if someone
tries to attack the hose.''

<DT>P. 113.
<DD>Under Beehive, ``combat table'' should be ``Weapon Table.''

<DT>P. 114.
<DD>Under ICMs (SB), the ``Weapons Effect Tables'' should be ``Weapon
Tables''.

<DT>P. 116.
<DD>Under Cannon-Launched Guided Projectiles (SB), delete the
reference to ``gravguns.''

<DT>P. 119-20: Stun beamers.
<DD>Delete the reference to sealed armor protecting totally. Add
``Every 5 points of DR gives +1 to HT to resist the stun beamer's
effects.''

<DT>P. 122.
<DD>Under Disintegrators, ``combat table'' should be ``Weapon Table.''

<DT>P. 123.
<DD>Under Sonar Homing Torpedoes, delete the asterisk.

<DT>P. 126.
<DD>ARM should have a ``*''. The rules for radar ``detectors'' are on
p.  69 - p. 171 is for ``radars.''

<DT>P. 127.
<DD>In the fourth full paragraph, ``GSH'' should be ``GH.''

<DT>P. 127.
<DD>Shooting at Missiles: Replace ``loses all its HT'' with ``takes 10
points of damage''.

<DT>P. 140.
<DD>In the G-Force sidebar, the table heading is wrong - the
Acceleration Effects Table is the sidebar on p. 141.  Also, delete the
line ``Anyone in a G-seat is at a bonus to protect against
acceleration (+6).''  A G-seat gives a +2 bonus, as its description
states.

<DT>P. 140.
<DD>The first Land Crash Table should be 0-3, not 1-3.

<DT>P. 141.
<DD>Add to the Terrain Effects Chart: If a powered wheeled vehicle
with off-road suspension does not have all-wheel drive (or if a
powered wheeled vehicle has all-wheel drive but not off-road
suspension) its top speed is 10% in soft terrain, 33%* in snow/ice, 5%
in broken, and 20% in forest.

<DT>P. 141.
<DD>Under Water, ``treated as marsh'' should be ``treated as soft''
terrain.

<DT>P. 143.
<DD>Roll 1d on the Aquatic Crash Table.

<DT>P. 143.
<DD>Under Flooding and Sinking, add the line ``Water pressure can only
crack the hull if it still contains pressure-tight compartments filled
with air. This is likely if the vessel has compartmentalization.''

<DT>P. 143.
<DD>Under Underwater Movement and Submarines, the reference to p. 64
should be to p. 65.

<DT>P. 145.
<DD>On the Aerial Crash Table, the entry 1-2 should be 0-2.

<DT>P. 146.
<DD>Replace the draft calculation with that on p. 55.

<DT>P. 148.
<DD>In the main text, 3rd paragraph, 3rd and 5th lines, change maximum
reverse speed to 20 mph from 10 mph.

<DT>P. 148.
<DD>Under Lighter-than-Air Flight, updrafts and downdrafts are not
listed ``below'' but on the Aerial Hazards sidebar on the same page.

<DT>P. 148.
<DD>Under Auto-Rotation, stall speed should be 15 mph, not 30 mph.

<PRE>
 	P. 149. The Falling Table should read:
	1st second      5 yards		 5 yards		 22 mph
	2nd second      16 yards	21 yards		44 mph
	3rd second      27 yards	48 yards		66 mph
	4th second      38 yards	86 yards		88 mph
	5th second      48 yards	134 yards	       110 mph
	6th second      59 yards	193 yards	       132 mph
</PRE>

<P>(The following note is courtesy of Walter Milliken, and we will try
to deal with the issue in the second edition:)

<P>Those who want a high level of realism should note: different
objects have different terminal velocities.  (Consider a feather and
an iron cannonball, for example.)  Note also that if a flat terminal
velocity of 130 mph applies for everything, a diving jet can't exceed
that speed with its engines off . . . The formula for terminal
velocity is:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
	SQRT [(2*m*g) / (Cd*rho*A)]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where Cd is the drag coefficient, rho is the air density, A is the
area of the object in the direction of motion, m is the object mass,
and g is the acceleration of gravity.  For <b><i>Vehicles</i></b> we
could equate m with loaded mass, A with armor factor, and pick some Cd
values to associate with the aerodynamic streamlining property.  On
Earth, at low altitudes, g and rho are constants. I believe the 130
mph value is for the human body, so one could assign typical mass and
area values and work the formula backwards from the 130 mph value to
get a simplified formula, something like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    k1 * SQRT(loaded mass/armor factor) * k2
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where k1 is a simple constant derived from working the human example and 
k2 is found in a table indexed by aerodynamic streamlining.  Correction 
multipliers could be applied for non-Earth conditions: multiply by 
SQRT(gravity) and a correction factor for atmospheric densities (as
given in <b><i>Space</i></b>: e.g., Trace, Thin, Superdense, etc.).

<DT>P. 151.
<DD>The p. 00 reference should be to p. 173. The speed reduction
calculation is backwards - it should be: [(HT + DR of barrier)/damage
done] × pre-crash speed.

<DT>P. 154.
<DD>Under Vehicular Combat Modifiers, ignore the modifiers given for
chameleon surface or ghostweb. Instead, use the modifiers for
chameleon surface, instant chameleon surface and ghost web (which
should be ghost surface) on p. 167, under visual spotting, as the
combat modifiers.

<DT>P. 155.
<DD>Specific targeting at masts/sails should be ``firing at
masts/sails/arms''. ``Firing at turret or superstructure . . . use
turret's size modifier'' should be ``Firing at turret or
superstructure . . .  use turret or superstructure's size modifier.''
Add ``Firing at body . . . use body's size modifier.''

<DT>P. 156.
<DD>Clarification to Dodging and Passive Defense: A battlesuit's dodge
may not exceed 14, just like any other vehicle.

<DT>P. 158.
<DD>Under Body, the p. 158 reference should be to p. 159.

<DT>P. 160.
<DD>On the Body Damage Location Table, delete the asterisk next to #14
(Fuel).

<DT>P. 162.
<DD>In the Ablative Armor sidebar, add ``If the armor regenerates, it
recovers lost DR at a rate of 1% of its original DR (minimum 1 DR)
every hour at TL10; this increases to every 10 minutes at TL11, every
minute at TL12, every 10 seconds at TL13, and every second at TL14+.''

<DT>P. 163.
<DD>Ammunition Explosions should say to roll 1d.

<DT>P. 167.
<DD>The Visual Spotting reference to ``ghost web'' should be ``ghost
surface.''

<DT>P. 169.
<DD>Under Battlesuit: Dodge and Damage, add this clarification:
``Battlesuit dodge cannot exceed 14.''

<DT>P. 169.
<DD>The Active Sonar reference to 5 yards depth = 1 yard horizontal
should be 1 yard depth = 5 yards horizontal.

<DT>P. 169.
<DD>The Hydrophone reference to 5 yards depth = 1 yard horizontal
should be 1 yard depth = 5 yards horizontal. The example contradicts
the text - a target 20 miles away should actually have a 2-mile
uncertainty.

<DT>P. 171.
<DD>In the Superstrength vs. Vehicles sidebar, 2nd paragraph, 6th
line, ``Distance thrown'' should be ``distance thrown (in yards)''.

<DT>P. 171.
<DD>Under IR and Thermograph Detection, ``ghostweb'' should be ``ghost
surface.''

<DT>P. 173.
<DD>Under Damaging Buildings, on the breaches chart, ``1,028 to 4,092xHT''
should be ``1,024 to 4,095xHT''.

<DT>P. 178.
<DD>In Example 1, Chiton's cost is actually $289,898 so its
maintenance interval is 289,898 x .0001 = 28.989. The square root is
5.38, rounded to 5. Dividing 200 by 5 we get 40. Chiton can operate
for 40 hours between tune-ups.

<P>Add: ``A vehicle built entirely of living metal or biomechanical
parts does not require maintenance. If parts are built from living
metal or biomechanical parts, deduct their cost from the vehicle's
cost before calculating maintenance interval.''

<DT>P. 181.
<DD>Under blueprints, note that team effort cannot reduce the time
required by more than 80%.

<DT>P. 181.
<DD>In the example, Chiton cost $289,898. The square root is 538.42.
It takes Neko 538.4 hours to design. 269.2 hours at 8 hours a day is
just over 33 days.

<DT>P. 182.
<DD>The time to build the prototype is the square root of (289,898/8)
= 190 man-hours. Chiton costs 100% of its base cost of $289,898 for
parts. Using the salvage rules, the cost is reduced to $173,938.80.

<DT>P. 183.
<DD>Change the first bug-squashing example to: ``It would take 5% of
538.4 man-hours, or just under 27 man-hours, and a successful
Engineering roll to fix the minor bug in Chiton's weapon system.'' In
the second example, change to: ``Modifying Chiton to eliminate the bug
in the chaingun would cost 8,696.9 and take 9.5 man-hours.''

<DT>P. 188.
<DD>The Executive Jet's ceiling is 13,352 yards.

<DT>P. 190.
<DD>In the Weapon Tables, delete the fifth line in the first paragraph
of text (''The statistics used on the charts are:'').

<DT>P. 191, TL5 Artillery table.
<DD>The 12-pounder SB cannon damage type should be ``cr.'' Delete
dagger mark for APX; replace with * and delete dagger footnote
entirely.

<DT>P. 192: Autocannon.
<DD>The ``double-dagger'' footnote is missing. It should be ``RoF is
gunner's skill/2.''

<DT>Pp. 193-197, 199.
<DD>All HE loads have exp damage.
<DD>All HEAT loads have sxp damage.

<DT>P. 193.
<DD>The damage for a TL6 30mm Autocannon with HEDP should be 3d(10)* sxp,
not 6d(10)* cr.

<DT>P. 194, TL6-8 Artillery.
<DD>In the footnote examples, gas should be 10 yard radius, starshell
would be 3,000 yard radius.

<DT>P. 195, TL6-7 Rifled Naval Guns.
<DD>Smoke example should be 60-yard radius; starshell example should
be 3,600-yard radius.

<DT>P. 195, TL6 Tank Guns.
<DD>The 37mm Gun with AP has a 1/2D of 500 and a Max of 1 mi.  The
37mm Gun with HE has a Max of 1 mi.  The 37mm Long-Barrel Gun has a
1/2D of 700.

<DT>P. 196.
<DD>In the footnote for liquid-propellant hypercannon on
electrothermal weapons, the reference to ``(see the weapon design
tables)'' should say ``(refer to the KWH/shot entry on the TL8
Hypercannon and Electrothermal Cannon table, p. 109)''.

<DT>P. 199.
<DD>There is no entry for the 150mm Railgun.  (We're trying to
determine its stats.)

<DT>P. 199.
<DD>Railguns: SATNUC footnote is missing its leading ``*''.

<DT>P. 200.
<DD>Under <i>Particle Beams [Gunner/TL (Particle Beam)]</i>, the TL9
Particle Accelerator Lt. C-PAWS has an SS of 25.

<DT>P. 202.
<DD>Disintegrators: Ignore damage on table. See text description
instead for accurate damage effects.

<DT>P. 203.
<DD>TL7 Guided Missiles: Lt. SAM/AAM damages should be 6d x 10 [8d]
instead of 6d x 10 (8d); Md. SAM/AAM should be 6d x 50 [12d] instead
of 6d x 50 (12d).

<DT>P. 203.
<DD>TL8 Guided Missiles: Hv. LSRM damage should have an !. Lt. LSRM
should have Shots ``1T''.

<DT>P. 204.
<DD>TL9+ Guided Missiles: Lt. LRGM should be 6d x 20 [12d], not 6d x
20 (12d). Delete the ! following Xh. LRGM damage. LRGM footnote on
tacnukes and chemical warheads should refer to pp. 111-112 and p. 115,
not p. 114.

<DT>P. 207.
<DD>Add an index entry for Advance Controls, 56.
<DD>Add an index entry for Dragonfly Wings, 29.
