<DT>P. 102.
<DD>Under <EM>Loading Mechanism</EM>, move revolver (TL5) and
mechanical Gatling (TL5) into the main list of options for cannon, and
delete the rest of the second sentence in that paragraph.  Having a
barrel size greater than 60 mm will reduce RoF (as per p. VE107), but

<DT>Pp. 102, 111.
<DD><EM>Kinetic-Energy-Class Ammunition</EM> and the <EM>Ammunition
Types by Class and TL</EM> table: Needle ammunition is TL8, not TL6,

in END under 0.5 second, the missile design is not feasible.  Alter
the speed of the missile and try again!''

<DT>P. 113.
<DD>In the notes, after ``C is the bore size cubed --
B&#215;B&#215;B'' add ``. Exception: If under 20mm, C is
400&#215;B''.

Fuel-Air Explosive, in first sentence, change ``usable only'' to
``often used''.

<DT>P. 114.

and put a `*' after APEX. Under ``Warhead cost (wcost):'' to the list
that begins ``&#215;$20 if LE'' add ``CHEM'' to the warhead types.
<DD>Under <i>Self-Destruct Systems</i>, add ``(see p. 70)'' after
``this may be a self-destruct system''.

<DT>P. 117.
<DD>Add this to the end of the first sentence under <i>Motors</i>:
``minimum 75.''
<DD>Under <i>Stealth</i>, the page references in the second
paragraph are to p. 91.

<DT>P. 118.
<DD>Under <EM>Damage, Kinetic Energy (Crushing or Impaling)
Damage</EM> change the bold formula to read ``DAM =
D&#215;V&#215;A&#215;W'' (the addition is the &#215;W).
<DD>Add this note under <i>Kinetic Energy (Crushing or Impaling)
Damage</i>: ``Damage is affected by warhead size. Multiply KE damage
by 0.5 if small, 0.625 if modest, 0.8 if normal, 0.9 if big or 1 if
huge.''

<DT>P. 120.
<DD>In the replace the third paragraph of the page (that began
``Record the torpedo's or missile's...") with the following: ``If END
is under 0.5, lower Spd and try again! Otherwise, record Spd and
End.''

weapons.

<DT>P. 125.
<DD>In the <EM>Damage (Dam.)</EM> formula in bold delete the ``E''
value, and put an asterisk next to the ``O'' in the formula, so that
the formula now reads ``Damage = (square root of O*)&#215;B&#215;T.
<DD>Under the note for B following Damage (DAM) replace ``0.04
for gravity or stunner'' with ``0.04 for gravity, 0.4 for stunner''
and for paralysis guns, change 1.6 to 0.3.
<DD>Delete the entire ``E'' paragraph under Damage (DAM) (the one that
begins ``E also depends'' and ends ``E is always 1'') and replace with
this new paragraph: ``* If output is under 1,000 kJ, multiply O by
0.03 instead of finding its square root.''
<DD>Under the note for T following Damage (DAM), change ``Remember
that <I>rainbow</I> lasers are TL9, not TL8'' to ``<I>Note</I>:
Particle beams under 10,000 kJ, and all rainbow lasers are TL9;

move the entry for neutral particle beam from the ``&#215; 10 if...''
listing to the ``&#215; 50 if ...'' listings, so that it follows
rainbow laser rather than flamer.

<DT>P. 127.
<DD>Under <EM>Cost</EM>, replace ``except UV, IR or rainbow models''
with ``except rainbow models''.

<DT>P. 130.
<DD>Immediately after <EM>Ground Pressure Table</EM>, in the sentence

<DD>In the second column, the short entry for Planing needs to be
rewritten to read as follows:<BR>
``<I>Planing:</I> If a vehicle's aquatic thrust is at least [(Hl &#215;
5) + 5]% of its loaded weight, it gets extra speed by planing --
