The Rrangoon are an alien race I designed. In GURPS terms, they're 
generally at TL8, save that they know practically nothing about 
electromagnetism or radiation (magnets are the latest "in-thing" for 
Rrangoon technophiles), save for some biologically-derived lasers 
(similar to the ones mentioned in David Brin's "Sundiver"). The 
following text describes what could be called an "orbital truck", 
hauling up to about 50 tons of bulk freight from one orbit to another.

accomplish, although a successful Piloting (Lightsail) roll will cut this 
to 15 minutes.)
