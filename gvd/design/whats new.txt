
Hi folks,

Here's whats been going on:

## Property Display Panel is now working again.
	## Not only is it working, but its been improved.  You can view the
properties for a component, _and_ you can view a Description of each
property and any relevant page information for where to find it in Vehicles
2nd Edition.  Both the description and page info are user modifieable.

## About 50% done with support for multiple vehicles at once.  Each vehicle
will appear on a seperate treeview tab.  Until the stats code is finished I
wont be able to finalize this.. but the framework is there.

## Finalized some loose ends with component icon loading (icons are loaded
from files now and can be modified by the user if you wish.)

## Started on the last of the really big work items... stats calculations.
This includes both component level stats and vehicle wide stats (though its
component level stats which are the main focus) Once this is done, I'll have
enuf of the code working where i might be able to compile an alpha.

Im really really excited with how this verison is coming along.  This
version will contain just
about all the features you've been screaming for since GVD first came out in
late 1999.  


Version 2.0?  What happened to version 1.5?  Well not only is Version 2.0 a
major program upgrade, its a near complete rewrite.  The new code base
warrants the major version increment from 1 to 2.0.  To all current
registered users, it will be a free update so have no fear.

GURPS Vehicles Designer 1.0 was the pioneer in providing GM's and players
with an intuitive drag and drop interface for creating GURPS vehicles.
Version 2.0 extends and refines that vision in such a way, that it will
continue to be the premeir software program for designing vehicles for years
to come.  There can be only one.


What's new in 2.0?

- Custom Component Editor
Users can now create their own components from virtually any GURPS source
book and use them inside GVD 2.0.  Further, your new components are first
class components which means not only will the stats be calculated for you
(unlike the old "custom" component)  but they will show up in performance
profiles, power system/fuel/weapon links, etc.  These are NOT generic
"custom" components.  Any component you make with the editor is treated just
like an intrinsic Vehicles component when it is loaded into the program.

- Metric System Madness
GVD 2.0 includes a wizard for formatting any "unit" type in GVD.  So if you
want to display all "lbs" as "kilograms", you can.  Further you can set cut
off values for displaying large values to yet a different conversion.  For
instance, if the weight goes over 10,000lbs display it in "tons,"
"kilotons," "metric tons,"  etc.  GVD's new unit conversion wizard leaves no
stone unturned.   It also allows you to set complex decimal rounding.  You
can also enter in a monetary conversion multiplier and have all the Cost and
Price stats show up in the currency of your choice!

- Totally Revamped "link" assignment interface
Fuel links, weapon links and power system links now share a revamped
interface for assigning engines to fuel tanks, weapons to grouped weapons
and power consumption components to generators.  The interface is more
intuitive and has been integrated into the main application window.  (the
problem with battery endurance and assigning rechargeable batteries to a
recharge source are solved as well.)

- Extensible GURPS text exporting capabilities
Via a plug-in interface, users can write their own routines to format the
GURPS text anyway they please.  This means that GVD 2.0 can support any
style of output you like.  Classic GURPS Vehicles formating, vanilla html,
htmal w/ Tables, you name it.  As soon as the plug-in  interface has been
finalized, I will release the spec so the programmers amongst you can work
on developing a custom plug-in.

- Missiles with multiple guidance systems and multiple warheads (provided
all warheads are of same kind)

- Multiple Vehicles At Once
Working on two or more different designs at the same time?  Well why work on
them one at a time when you can have each loaded into the program at the
same time?

- Improved Graphical User Interface
	- Improved Armor Interface
	- Totally New Crew Station Assignment Interface

- Faster, Leaner, More Flexible and Robust!
Building a huge vehicle in GVD 1.0 and tired of the slow statistic updates?
GVD 2.0 has been rewritten in a way that will allow you to create larger
vehicles without experiencing the long statistic update.  (also no more
overflow crashes when building that monolithic spaceship of your dreams.)

All that and more.  I can tell you that all of the above features are either
already complete or are in various stages of completion.  In other words,
the above feature list is in fact set in stone.  When will it be "released?"
Ive been horrible with hitting release dates so I wont give one.  I made
huge progress over the past 5 days and there are essentially 3 main work
items left.  When they are done I will release a beta in order to get
feedback.  Stay tuned.
