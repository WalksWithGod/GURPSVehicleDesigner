<P>Right before the Battle of Endor, the Emperor ordered the construction of a 
new type of vessel, the Eclipse-class Super Star Destroyer. Based on the design 
for the Super Star Destroyer, this vessel would be over twice as long. The great 
black ship continued to be built, deep in the Core, for the following six years. 
Supposedly, Palpatine, though weakened by his death at Endor, made sure the 
construction continued until he was able to return as the rightful leader of the 
Empire. So when he came back, the Eclipse was waiting for him. The mighty vessel 
was 17.5 kilometers long, over twice the length of a Super-class ship, and 
almost as long as 11 Imperial Star Destroyers. It had a black hull, designed to 
inspire dread and hopelessness in every opponent. The main weapon of the Eclipse 
was its spine-mounted superlaser. The superlaser, though not as powerful as the 
Death Star's version, was powerful enough to render worlds uninhabitable. The 
ship also had shields and a hull so strong that it could ram most any ship 
without hesitation. The first Eclipse, the prototype, was destroyed (just barely 
after being completed) over the moon Da Soocha V. The second ship, the Eclipse 
II, took far less time to build, and participated in several battles before it, 
too, was destroyed.</P>

<P>The Sovereign-class Super Star Destroyer was meant to be a smaller version of 
the Eclipse. Palpatine wanted to create a fleet of Sovereigns. He began 
constructing them, starting with the Sovereign itself, somewhere deep in the 
Core. But Palpatine died before he could complete the vessels, so no one knows 
what has happened to them.</P>
