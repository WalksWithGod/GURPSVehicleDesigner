<P>The Clone Wars brought about many technological advances in the Old Republic. 
The greatest of these achievements was the Victory Star Destroyer. The 
Victory-class Star Destroyer was designed by Republic engineer Walex Blissex 
near the end of the Clone Wars. It was the most powerful ship of its time, 
dwarfing the Republic Dreadnaught by 300 meters. However, the Victory Star 
Destroyer saw little action during the Republic. Later, after Palpatine had 
declared himself Emperor and incorporated the Imperial-class Star Destroyer into 
the fleet, the ships were only used for guarding unimportant systems and bases. 
But when the Rebellion was at its height, the Victory ships got to do there part 
as well. By the time Grand Admiral Thrawn took command of the Empire, the 
Victory was being used almost as much as the Imperials. Five years later, the 
warlord High Admiral Teradoc had an entire fleet consisting of nothing but 
Victory Star Destroyers, and they were just as powerful as his rival's fleet of 
Imperial Star Destroyers. The Victory Star Destroyer is still very much a part 
of the present-day Imperial fleet.</P>
<P>The Victory Star Destroyer is excellent for planetary assault and defense, as 
they are the only Star Destroyer that can enter a planet's gravity. The huge 
atmospheric maneuvering fins on either side of the ship along with its massive 
repulsorlift generators enable it to do that. This does, however, limit the 
Victory's ship-to-ship combat. Also, the repulsors give the Victory a very slow 
sublight speed, but that is made up for by the amazingly fast hyperdrive. The 
Victory also has two squadrons of TIE fighters, as well as planetary assault 
troops.</P>
<P>The Victory II-class Star Destroyer solves most of these problems. The 
Victory II was made just after the Clone Wars. The Victory II does not have the 
repulsors or the fins like the Victory I, which gives the Victory II a greater 
sublight speed than the much slower Victory I. Also, the Victory II is better 
for ship-to-ship combat, but the missile launchers had to be sacrificed. The 
Victory II has better weapons, a stronger hull, and, consequently, a larger 
crew. The Victory IIs are especially good when working in teams, and they can 
easily stop most any opponent. Very few Victory IIs were made, though. They were 
produced at the end of the Clone Wars, and when the wars ended, the Old Republic 
stopped making Victory IIs.</P>
