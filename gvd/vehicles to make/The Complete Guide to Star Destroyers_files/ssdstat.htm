<P>It is interesting that one of the greatest warships ever built was never 
given its due respect by the Rebel Alliance. Many histories persist in calling 
Lord Vader's flagship a "super star destroyer." This is a very loose and 
overused term the Rebels have given a number of ships, regardless of their 
actual class. Any Star Destroyer larger than the standard Imperator-class is 
called a Super Star Destroyer, whether it is the 2 km long Allegiance or the 17 
km long Eclipse. In the interest of continuity, the Executor and similar ships 
have been classified as Super Star Destroyers. This entry will only include 
statistics for the most common of the "Super-class" vessels: the Executor-class 
command ship. The <A 
href="http://www.hyperjump.net/swguides/sdguide/essdstat.html" 
target=_self>Eclipse- and Sovereign-classes</A> have their own entry, while 
"oddities," such as the Allegiance and Shockwave, are only briefly described 
here. For more information on the other Super Star Destroyers, read their 
individual entries in the Complete List of Star Destroyer Names.<BR>&nbsp;</P>

<P>After the destruction of the first Death Star, Darth Vader ordered the 
construction of the first of a new class of vessels. Designed by Lira Wessex, 
designer of the Imperator-class Star Destroyer, the Executor-class Star 
Destroyer was born. The first of this line, the Executor, was an amazing feat. 
At 8 kilometers long, the Executor was five times the size of an Imperial Star 
Destroyer. The Executor was also five times as powerful, with 1,000 weapon 
emplancements. The huge vessel had 12 squadrons (two wings) of TIE fighters, 
plus many ground assault troops. <IMG height=210 alt="SSD Terror" 
src="ssdstat_files/terror.gif" width=280 align=right border=1 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Three other Executor-class ships were made before the Battle 
of Hoth, though many more were made between then and Endor. Amazingly, by the 
time Grand Admiral Thrawn took command of the Empire, there were no longer any 
Super Star Destroyers in Imperial hands. More were made after Thrawn's death, 
each more advanced than the originals. But the Executor-class Star Destroyer 
remained the ultimate ship in the galaxy.</P>
<P>The Super Star Destroyer was an 8 km long behemoth. It could take on whole 
fleets by itself. Nothing the Rebels had could compete with the mighty craft. 
Though supposedly the Rebels did capture one Super from the Empire, they 
scrapped it since they believed that many smaller ships were better than one 
giant vessel. The Super Star Destroyer does have the downside of being slow and 
combersome. Despite the vast amount of weapontry aboard the ship, it often 
served the role of command ship, guiding huge fleets of vessels.</P>
<P>The Super Star Destroyer design has been slightly altered through the years. 
The Terror had a cloaking device. The Night Hammer had black stealth armor, as 
well as several additional squadrons of TIE fighters. In fact, all 
late-production Supers had a third shield generator tower along their 
centerline. Also, the Sovereign- and Eclipse-class Super Star Destroyers (see <A 
href="http://www.hyperjump.net/swguides/sdguide/essdstat.html">seperate 
entry</A>) were greatly improved from the original Super-class design.</P>

  <BR>AUTHOR'S NOTE ON THE EXECUTOR'S LENGTH: I have received many e-mails 
  regarding a website known as the <A href="http://www.theforce.net/swtc">Star 
  Wars Technical Commentaries</A> and its discussion of the true length of the 
  Executor. I read this web page long before I created this website, and have 
  confirmed a great deal of the author's data firsthand. I agree that ILM 
  designed the Executor to be eleven times the size of an Imperial Star 
  Destroyer, not the five-times-as-long stated by West End Game's Imperial 
  Sourcebook. However, in the interest of continuity, I have kept the WEG length 
  of 8,000 meters. All of the novels, sourcebooks and comics in the Expanded 
  Universe of Star Wars have used WEG's stats, and I feel that changing them 
  here would cause too much confusion. The number of crew, weaponry, and carried 
  starfighters is based on the length of 8 km, and we have no official stats for 
  the 11-mile-long Executor. Also, the Eclipse was meant to be twice the length 
  of the Executor, which at 10 miles long, it obviously would not be. So, in 
  conclusion, while I personally feel the Executor was meant to be 11 miles 
  long, the "official" length has now become 5 miles, and I am sticking to 
  that.<BR>

<P>One noteworthy class of "Super Star Destroyer" is the Allegiance-class. At 
least four of this class have been positively identified, with several more 
unconfirmed sightings. At 2.2 km long, the Allegiance is significantly longer 
than an Imperator-class Star Destroyer, thus provoking the Rebels to deem it a 
"Super Star Destroyer." The ship resembles an enlarged Imperator-class, but 
lacks the main hanger bays and other minor hull features. Most likely this ship 
was designed to coordinate large-scale attacks; exactly the function the 
Allegiance was serving at the Battle of Calamari. Three other Allegiance-class 
ships were sighted escorting the Emperor's flagship Eclipse to the Rebel base at 
Pinnacle Moon. The names of these vessels was not confirmed, and they were 
either scattered or destroyed by the Emperor's rampaging Force storm. No other 
Allegiance-class command ships have been positively identified, but it is 
possible that the Star Destroyer Shockwave was a derivative of this class.</P>

<P></P>
<P>Over the course of the Empire's 25-year building spree, many ships classified 
as Star Destroyers were longer than the standard 1.6 km Imperator-class Star 
Destroyer. Since many of these vessels were unique and, for the most part, 
unidentified, this guide will not cover them in great detail. Many of these are 
like the Shockwave (Warlord Harsk's flagship), built as command ships for fleets 
that did not rate an Executor-class vessel. These "super star destroyers" vary 
in size and capacity, ranging from 2 km to over 10 km. Because a great number of 
these ships were kept in reserve in the Deep Core, and many were lost with the 
destruction of the Imperial throneworld of Byss, they will never be fully 
cataloged.</P><PRE><HR align=left></PRE>
