<P>The Imperial Star Destroyer is truly a marvel of modern engineering. While 
earlier vessels had been longer, few of them were as powerful or as massive as 
the Imperator. While the designation "star destroyer" is a misnomer, since the 
ISD is classified as a star battlecruiser, the Imperator was seen as the direct 
successor to the Victory. It may also have been kind of a threat: if the 
Empire's destroyers were a mile long, how big would an Imperial battleship 
be?</P>
<P>Over the years, there have been many modifications and variations on the 
Imperator design. Minor hull features and the placement of sensors have created 
numerous models of the ISD, but all are based on two main classes: the Imperator 
I and the Imperator II. In addition to these, other Star Destroyers have been 
modified to serve as command ships, communication vessels, interdictor cruisers, 
heavy bombardment warships, and countless other variations. Several of these are 
discussed below; the most obvious type, the heavily modified <A

<P>The dawn of a new era under Emperor Palpatine saw the creation of a new class 
of Star Destroyer. The mighty Imperator was designed by Lira Wessex, the 
daughter of the Victory Star Destroyer's designer.</P>
<P>The Senate fought the design, pointing to the enormous cost of construction 
and the amount of fund that would be needed to maintain even one of these 
warships. But the newly strengthened Imperial Navy demanded that the ship be 
built, and the Emperor agreed with them. Thus Kuat Drive Yards produced the 
first of the 1.6 km long Imperator-class Star Destroyer (and only 50 million 
credits over budget, too).</P>
<P><IMG height=222 src="isdstat_files/gorgon.gif" width=243 align=right 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Grand Moff Tarkin, creator of the Death Star battlestation, 
once said: "It has long been my contention that the average citizen has no grasp 
of numbers nor a head for calculation. I maintain that one of the reasons for 
the effectiveness of the Star Destroyer is its size. When citizens look at a 
Star Destroyer and then look at the craft which might be made available to 
attack it, event he best mind among them wishes to reject the notion rather than 
approach the problem tactically." While Tarkin is undoubtedly underestimating 
the destructive firepower of the Imperator-class Star Destroyer, his point is 
certainly valid. A ship so large that it can swallow up the craft that make up 
most planetary defense navies, not to mention deploy hundreds of its own carried 
craft, has its advantages. The Imperial Star Destroyer graphically demonstrates 
Emperor Palpatine's philosophy of "rule through fear of force".</P>
<P>The Imperial Navy poured billions of credits into the Star Destroyer project. 
This mighty vessel, which could turn an entire civilization into ruin, soon 
became the backbone of the Imperial Starfleet. Over 120 heavy weaponry can 
decimate enemy fleets, while the full wing of 72 TIE fighters can overwhelm 
enemy starfighters. Virtually a fortress in space, the ISD also carries ground 
assault troops, including an entire division of Stormtroopers.</P>
<P>Between the time of the launching of the original Imperator and the rebirth 
of Emperor Palpatine, over 20,000 Star Destroyers were built. No ship built 
during this period could match the Star Destroyer in open combat, though two of 
the Rebel Mon Calamarian monstrosities could perhaps defeat it. While the MC90 
Star Cruiser and later Mon Cal designs are superior craft, the Star Destroyer is 
still not outclassed 25 years after the Battle of Endor. In an attempt to 
improve the lifespan of existing ships, the Empire has upgraded weapons systems 
and installed cloaking devices on most of their ships. During the 
Imperator-class Star Destroyer's 50-year service it has seen as many failures as 
it has successes. Nevertheless, the ship remains an excellent design and a 
testimony to Imperial might.</P>

<P>Approximately one year after the Battle of Yavin, a new subclass of the 
Imperial Star Destroyer began appearing. It is not known exactly when the first 
Imperator II Star Destroyers entered service, because their construction was 
kept top secret. Needless to say, the Rebel Alliance fleet was stunned when they 
first encountered a Mark II.</P>
<P>The original Imperial Star Destroyer was considered a masterpiece, but it was 
not without flaws. The Imperial Navy decided that heavier firepower was needed 
for planetary bombardment, and that 60 ion cannons were far more than were 
necessary. Therefore, the Imperator II design removed forty ion cannons and 
replaced them with heavy turbolasers. The hyperdrive was improved, giving the 
Mark II an impressive x1 hyperdrive. The particle shielding was also increased, 
probably in response to the destruction of the Death Star and the threat of 
Rebel torpedo attacks.</P>
<P>The Mark II's were rarities for a long time, but eventually all new Star 
Destroyers were of this class. Once Star Destroyer construction was restarted 
under Grand Admiral Thrawn, it is believed that only Mark II's were built by the 
remaining Imperial shipyards. The Imperator II is able to hold its own against 
modern New Republic warships such as the MC90, and is still used by the Imperial 
Navy over 20 years after the Battle of Endor.</P>

<P>Over the fifty year period during which the Empire constructed 
Imperator-class Star Destroyers of one kind or another, many modified ships were 
developed. Some were merely test beds for new propulsion and weapons systems, 
but most were modified for a specific purpose. Some have become their own 
classes, including the Interdictor Star Destroyer described below, and the <A 
href="http://www.hyperjump.net/swguides/sdguide/ssdstat.html#a">Allegiance-class 
Command Ship</A>, described elsewhere in this guide.</P>

<P>under construction</P>
<P><A name=communications></A><B>Communications Ships</B></P>
<P>The only know Star Destroyer designed as a communications ship was at the 
battle of Endor. This slightly larger Star Destroyer (whose name is unknown) was 
responsible for the broad-band jamming that prevented the Rebels from detecting 
the Imperial fleet and the status of the Death Star's deflector shield. It was 
as well protected as a regular Star Destroyer, but may have had fewer guns. 
Several standard Star Destroyers worked as transmission relays for this main 
communications ship, including the Imperator II-class Star Destroyer Avenger. 
The communications ship was the target of a major starfighter Rebel attack, and 
was destroyed. No other dedicated communications ships are known.</P>
<P><A name=command></A><B>Command Ships</B></P>
<P>Before the Executor-class Super Star Destroyer was available in large 
numbers, most fleets were led by slightly modified Imperator-class Star 
Destroyers. Often the modifications would only include larger officer quarters 
and additional communications equipment. Some command ships would be more 
heavily armored, or even include advanced tactical computers for fleet 
coordination. The more significant flagships were usually larger as well, such 
as the post-Endor flagship of Warlord Harrsk, the Shockwave. The ISD Majestic, 
which served as the Emperor's flagship, was modified to include chambers for the 
Emperor and his guardsmen. In fact, any ship that might serve as the Emperor's 
flagship (including all Executor-class vessels) also included a throne room, 
much like the one on the second Death Star.</P><PRE><HR align=left></PRE>
<P><A name=ties></A><B><FONT size=+1>TIE Compliment aboard Imperial Star 
Destroyers</FONT></B></P>
<P>The most common TIE compliment, listed in the statistics above, was 
standardized shortly before the Battle of Endor. The earliest Star Destroyers 
carried a motley assortment of fighters, mainly consisting of the original TIE 
Starfighter. Several years before the destruction of the first Death Star, one 
fighter squadron was replaced with a squadron of TIE/gt Ground Support 
fighter/bombers. With the invention of the TIE Bomber, all TIE/gt were replaced 
by the time of the Battle of Hoth. When the TIE Interceptor entered service, 
they began slowly replacing TIE fighter squadrons. At first, most Star 
Destroyers only carried one squadron of Interceptors, but by the time of the 
Battle of Endor, most ships carried the standard compliment mentioned above. 
After the Battle of Endor, the Empire concentrated on producing new versions of 
the TIE Interceptor (which included shields), and slowly phased out the original 
TIE Starfighter. While some Destroyers carried specialty craft, such as TIE 
Defenders, TIE/D droid fighters, and Scimitar Assault Bombers, most Star 
Destroyers carried shielded TIE Interceptors and one squadron of Bombers until 
15 to 20 years after the Battle of Endor. Around the time of the peace treaty 
between the Empire and New Republic, many Imperial Star Destroyers also carried 
SoroSuub Preybird Assault Fighters, which were obtained from questionable 
third-party sources, and not the pro-Alliance SoroSuub Corporation.</P><PRE><HR align=left></PRE>
