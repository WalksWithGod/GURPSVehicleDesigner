A few ideas: first, take a look at the excellent Star Wars Techical
Commentaries (http://www.theforce.net/swtc/). These try and find a
pseudo-scientific basis for a lot of Star Wars technology, and do quite well
IMO.

My idea for SW starships is this: drives are reaction-less, and are actually
more similar to Star Trek Warp Drives than traditional reaction drives. The
drive creates a distortion in space which it 'rides' like a surfer on a wave.
There is a maximum distortion a drive can create, which in effect gives you a
maximum speed, even in vacuum. If a drive is shut down, the wave will die out,
and the ship will coast to a halt.

The ship, and occupants, experience no acceleration G (which fits the films)
and turns can be performed by changing the direction the wave propogates
through space. Deceleration occurs be dampening the wave, which means that
ships slow down without turning around.

The wave distortion creates a lot of waste heat and light - this
'dislocation' occurs on plates at the rear of the ship - hence the glowing
engines of SW ships that are lit all the time.

Hyperdrive is as per GURPS:Space, but alternatively you could say that it's
just a device the massively amplifys this wave, and somehow allows the ship
to go superluminal (note that SW ships still have their drives lit in
hyperspace, and there is a sudden burst of light from the engines as they
'jump').

Anti-grav is as per GURPS, but vehicles alternatively use pressor beams to
push off against the ground ('repulsorlift'). Newton says that pushing
against something pushes you the opposite direction ! Make these very short
range for 'ground' craft, to limit their altitude to a few metres. Also,
maybe the pressor works against the mass as a whole, and not just the bit
directly underneath the vehicle (so you don't get squashed pedestrians from
overhead speeders...)

Weapons are blasters and ion cannons (as per electro-lasers in GURPS). In SW,
'laser', 'turbo-laser' etc all mean 'blaster'. The Death Star's 'Super Lasers'
and probably some kind of antimatter blaster. Energy screens are per GURPS.

Use the Space Opera Combat System for space combat, and play it fast and
loose !

As for using vehicles, you need to decide how YOU want things to work, and
then create the rules to support this, using Vehicles as a guideline. There
are plenty of technical descriptions of SW ships - try reverse engineering
one.

Please post any SW vehicles you create. If I get the time I'll try and do the
same !
