Why not hull-mounted like those in a Harrier? This should cut the area 
to be armored, and IIRC an unmanned vehicle doesn't need access space.

What about a compact, high-RoF weapon for missile defense?

* Why did you take two different radios? The cost and mass difference between
  a long range radio and a medium radio becomes almost neglible at this TL.

* Where are the rearview sensors? 

* I'd want triple INS - that way, the XAU can tell which one went buggy.

This writeup doesn't clarify whether you have 45+45+15 or 45+15 minutes 
endurance. Either way, the numbers seem buggy. Your engines should burn 3,820
gph each. 11461 gallons should last for 90 minutes. Is that enough?

Are you sure expensive materials are necessary? See above for surface
cuts to compensate.

Not nearly enough at this TL.

Humans are probably the 'underdog', and that means they should prefer passive
sensors to active sensors. Radical emission cloaking and basic stealth might 
be a better mix.

Q: How do you ground a Terrorhawk?
A: You stuff a few pounds of trash inside, and it can't take off any more.

I'd want more power reserves.

What about this countermeasure?
