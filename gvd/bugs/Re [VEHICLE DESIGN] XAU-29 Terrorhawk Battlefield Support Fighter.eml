I will tell you my #1 peeve right now w/ GVD.  The inability to copy
components--any kind, not just weaponry--and paste them into other parts of
the vehicle.

It's something like this, you get a big idea for a vehicle, and load up GVD.
You going, gung ho, all set--then, the tedium of making and remaking the same
component over and over again, b/c it resides in differing subassemblies.  The
eyes roll, you get tired, suddenly, your not that hot to finish your vehicle.

This is exactly what you are trying to avoid w/ GVD.  I'm not a progger, so
I'm not sure what kind of difficulties there are in putting in Cut, Copy, and
Paste commands, but it should be your #1 thing to fix.  You want to keep
people in thier chair designing thier vehicle from start to finish, w/ out the
teduim--which is the #1 defeater of programs like this.  If it's not fun, AND
easy, people will get turned off.  Sales would spike at the beginning, I would
expect, then level, and finally drop off after word gets around.

Other than that, I'm going to redo my vehicle in GVD and see if the numbers
jive.

Also, I've been meaning to email you about your Electromags again.  They're
spitting out funky damage dice.  I built my 457mm Hellfire naval cannon, long
barrel, normal power, and that (unless I did the formula wrong in my SS)
should come out to something like 1645d (5d*329).  When I build w/ GVD, it
spits out 6d*305!  Way too much.  Even if 1645 was divisible by 6, it would
only come out to 6d*274.744...  Which brings my to my other "gripe"--not all
damage dice will be divisible by six.  Maybe have something that finds the
correct number divisible by and use it.  Most will be divisible by 5 or 6,
maybe have a 9 and a 4 option.  Also, some damages may not have to be divided.
I would say anything under 10d would be a no no to divide, between 12 and 16
an option to divide.  Some numbers you just CAN'T divide, like 11 and 13.  Can
GVD accomodate that?  Most users would probably like to pick what thier damage
is divided by, that would be a nice feature, but not real necessary as long as
GVD came up w/ correct numbers.

I think that's it for now.
