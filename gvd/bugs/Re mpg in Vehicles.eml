No it doesn't.  Vehicles performance rules (any version) are fairly incorrect,
but appear to be intended to produce relatively reasonable results for typical
vehicles.  Realistic performance figures cannot be generated without fairly
complicated math (for my attempt at doing a better job, see
http://www.io.com/GURPSnet/Archive/Vehicles/Construction/grdspeed).
