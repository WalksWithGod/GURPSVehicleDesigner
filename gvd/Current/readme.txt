Getting Started!
-----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for evaluating the GURPS Vehicle Designer!  We hope 
you will find this program fun and easy to use.  Here are
some quick steps to help you create your first vehicles...
but we dont think you'll even need them!

1) Launch the Gurps Vehicle Designer by clicking the program
   icon in your Start Menu
2) The program will start and you'll notice there are three
   columns.
3) The middle column contains all of the various parts that 
   you can add to your vehicle.  You can change which parts
   appear in the middle list by changing component types in 
   the two drop down lists.
4) To add a component from the middle column, click on the 
   desired component and while keeping the left mouse button 
   pressed, drag the component onto the "Body" in the left
   column.  You can add more parts by dragging them from the 
   middle column and releasing them onto the specific parts
   in the Vehicle tree that forms.
5) In the right most colum you can edit the specific features
   of the selected component.  You will notice that all
   statistics are automatically calculated after each
   modification you make.
6) The statistics along the left most side of the program are
   TOTAL vehicle stats.  The statistics in red print in the 
   right most column are the stats of the selected component
   only.
7) To edit other options such as Streamlining and Crew, click
   the "wrench" icon.
8) That's all there is to it!
