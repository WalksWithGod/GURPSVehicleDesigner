	<Comment> ; CMP files save file version data, author data, and saved states for properties which are defined by the user at run time.  Nothing more.
	 	 ; ACTUALLY, just thought of something cooler.  Should be that users dont have access to GCD files.  Only I create those.  Users on the other
	 	 ; hand, can over-ride those values in a GCD if they want, but they only have access to GCD properties which I expose for them.  
	 	 ; So, they can override the default NAME of a component (This also faciliates me not having to write as many GCD files), its default values
	 	 ; etc.  Plus, a CMP will be able to restore values.  REMEMBER, there is a (NO?) difference between a saved CMP and the components saved in 
	 	 ; an entire Vehicle FILE!!!  
	 	 ; When loading a CMP:
		  ; 1. Check its valid xml
	 	 ; 2. Check its Def file exists in correct path
	 	 ; 3. Check Def is valid
		  ; 4. Start loading Component stuff.  If anything is missing, default to DEF, if not in Def either, ABORT
