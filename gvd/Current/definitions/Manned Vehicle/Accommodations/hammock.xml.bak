	<Comment>  1) How to track armor? Default settings?  Layering?
		   2) How to track Component Group -- only applicable too .CMP though
                   3) These .DEF files shouldnt contain "Groups" right?  Just single components.
		   4) Since .CMP can contain groups, must be way to enforce that .CMP's only have one
 		      entire vehicle is different because you get to restore the exact same key values.  But adding a branch, the key might already be used.
		      For example, say you have Armor component who's parent key is set to that of another component in the restoring file.  That restored parent
		      has its key change (and certainly its object handle) so now the armor needs its key updated.  Issue here is to make sure we add these all through
		      AddObject and pretend we are adding them one at a time but just using a script to do the adding.   Incidentally, thats how battlesuits should be ;loaded...via script.

		I dont think i need this crap.  Actually, maybe i do so that when user "saves" a component, it goes into
		the right folder with other components of its type?

	<comment> These are used for both property display, and print output display.  for print output, user GuRPSify.dll
		  takes all this data and parses it into a print string on their own

		<Comment>This holds list of classes that are EXCLUDED from being attached to it.  As a rule, we already know
			 That any component can attach to any Container and that Real Containers can accept any component including Logical Containers
			 and Quantity Containers.   So the list of Location elements should contain EXCEPTS to these simple rules.  This is alot
 			 simpler than tracking which objects CAN be attached since MOST can.

			It would actually be simpler, to come up with a scheme for describing attributes of a Child which a parent
			wont accept.  for instance, if a child component is PropulsionType, then a particular container wont accept it.  This
			is much more elegant by far.
